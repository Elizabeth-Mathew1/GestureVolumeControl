### :mortar_board:  About the project

Gesture Volume Control is a simple application, in which the user can use simple hand getsures to change the system volume. This is made using OpenCV,
which is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. The project also uses Osascript, which is used for running Aplle scripts 
and manipulate the systems volume. So if you are chilling, listening to your favourite spotify track, 
and you feel the volume is just not right, it can be changed in the gentle swish and flick of your hands.
